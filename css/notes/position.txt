     -> The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document

     # static: default (The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect)

     # relative: element is relative to itself (The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties will work )

     # absolute: positioned relative to its closest positioned/non-static ancestor/parent/parent of the parent. (removed from the flow ) 

       - /* 
        position: absolute; moves element above and other elements move below it
        position: relative; is used to limit the child element according to the parent
        position: relative; is always assigned to the parent
