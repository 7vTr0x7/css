     -> The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document

     # static: default (The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect)

     # relative: element is relative to itself (The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties will work )

     # absolute: positioned relative to its closest positioned/non-static ancestor/parent/parent of the parent. (removed from the flow ) 

       - /* 
        position: absolute; moves element above and other elements move below it
        position: relative; is used to limit the child element according to the parent
        position: relative; is always assigned to the parent
        */

     # fixed
        -> positioned relative to the browser.(removed from the flow)  

     # sticky 
        -> position based on user's scroll position    

       
     # z-index 
        ->  It decides the stake level of elements
           Overlapping elements with a larger z-index cover those with a smaller one
