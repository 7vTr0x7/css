          - main-axis: left to right and cross-axis: top to bottom

       - flex-direction: row-reverse
          - main axis: right to left and cross-axis: top to bottom

       - flex-direction: column
          - main axis: top to bottom and cross-axis: left to right
       - flex-direction: column-reverse
          - main axis: bottom to top and cross-axis: left to right

          

      # flex container  

        -> justify-content: alignment along the main axis
           - flex-start/flex-end/center/space-between/space-around/space-evenly   

        -> align-items:  alignment along the cross-axis
           - center/flex-start-flex-end

        -> flex-wrap: 
           - flex-wrap: no wrap (default)
